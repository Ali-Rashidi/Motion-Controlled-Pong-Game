# Motion-Controlled-Pong-Game
One of the projects of the course "Robotics" by Prof. M. T. Masouleh at University of Tehran.

Created a motion-controlled Pong game using Python, IMU sensor, and Arduino. The Python environment implements the game, while Arduino enables connectivity between the IMU sensor and the interface, offering users an interactive gaming experience.
